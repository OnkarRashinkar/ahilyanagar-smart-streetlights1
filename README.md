# Ahilyanagar Smart Streetlights — Clustered LDR Pilot

**Location:** Pipeline Road, Dnyaneshwar Nagar, Savedi, Ahilya Nagar, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India  
**Author:** Onkar Rashinkar

## Project Summary
Streetlights in the Ahilya Nagar region frequently remain ON during daylight and sometimes turn on late during low-light days (monsoon). This pilot proposes a **cluster-based LDR (photocell) automation** where one LDR controls 10–20 streetlights via a relay/switch, reducing sensors, cost, and maintenance while ensuring timely switching.

## Why this matters
- Estimated **20–35% energy savings** in pilot area
- Reduced manual labour and fewer scheduling errors
- Improved public safety during unexpected low-light conditions
- Scalable and low-cost solution for other wards/cities

## Contents
- `PROJECT_BRIEF_MIT.pdf` — MIT-style brief with diagram and impact analysis  
- `PILOT_PROPOSAL_AHILYA_NAGAR.pdf` — formal proposal for municipality & MSEB  
- `diagrams/` — system and impact visuals  
- `code/demo_ldr_arduino.ino` — optional Arduino demo for local validation

## How to use
1. Review `PILOT_PROPOSAL_AHILYA_NAGAR.pdf` for the formal request to municipality/MSEB.  
2. Use `PROJECT_BRIEF_MIT.pdf` as documentation to include in college applications (link it in essays).  
3. If running a pilot: install sensors per cluster, monitor 30 days, measure kWh saved and failure rate.
